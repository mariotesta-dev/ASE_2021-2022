# ASE_2021-2022

This repository contains my personal solutions for exam-like ARM exercises of the course "Architetture dei Sistemi di Elaborazione" held on Polytechnic University of Turin in academic year 2021/2022.

Every folder contains the PDF of the exercise and a Keil uVision 5.0 project which needs a LPC1768 board or the equivalent simulator to run.

### Disclaimer:
The solutions proposed works, but haven't been deeply tested. <br/>They don't replace teaching material and are just for demonstration purpose.
